Game ideas #####################################################################################################################
- Designed like a 'consumer-based' game where the player will need to constantly eat and drink things to keep fighting
	- setting cards are interacted with to produce many of the replenishment items
	- the challenge will be that enemy cards can be on timers and may get stronger or activate an event over time
	- player needs to balance producing items over attacking enemies
	- npcs can be attacked for a quick bump in food/drinks, but remove the ability to interact with them
- Player will have two bars along each side of the card, indicating health and damage
	- damage bar can go down, will need to be replenished with items
- Enemies may have these same bars or will have a value indicating how much damage and health they have
	- Some enemies will stack their cards to become stronger over time
