Info ###########################################################################################################################
Each card type (Player, Settings, Entity, Object) will need to be a child class of the base card class
See examples to match card color and symbols

Use piskelapp to draw art

Next priority is to get enemy cards functioning
	We are going to start with the shack card and have it periodically spawn goblins
	For now, each goblin will drop a milk when defeated to replenish the player

Tasks ##########################################################################################################################
- Card should only be able to be dragged within the yellow play area and flash the card red to indicate the card could not be dragged
	need health/attack values
- Card Artwork (Kenny)
	Enemy cards
	Settings Cards
	Object Cards
- Sound Effects
	When clicking on a card
	When card attacks
	When card dies
	When a card is created
	Background Music
- Improve menu graphics/effects
- The shack spawns goblins after a timer, show timer progress with a bar below the card
- When cards are attacking or interacting, display a progress bar below them and set an arbitrary timer for fight progress
- Allow object to stack below an entity card and buff entity cards that will sit on top
- Enemy cards can stack somehow...
- Allow the user to store cards on the left
	- Might remove this ability and just have all cards laid out on the play area
- When hovering over a card, display a box in the bottom right corner of the screen to describe the card and provide higher detail stats
- Make the left area a backpack/storage area for cards (maybe)

Game ideas #####################################################################################################################
- Designed like a 'consumer-based' game where the player will need to constantly eat and drink things to keep fighting
	- setting cards are interacted with to produce many of the replenishment items
	- the challenge will be that enemy cards can be on timers and may get stronger or activate an event over time
	- player needs to balance producing items over attacking enemies
	- npcs can be attacked for a quick bump in food/drinks, but remove the ability to interact with them
- Player will have two bars along each side of the card, indicating health and damage
	- damage bar can go down, will need to be replenished with items
- Enemies may have these same bars or will have a value indicating how much damage and health they have
	- Some enemies will stack their cards to become stronger over time
