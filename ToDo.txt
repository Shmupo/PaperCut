3. Initial Cards should spawn in the rectangle on the left
4. Need background music
	Maybe make the card slightly larger / add a shadow
7. IMPORTANT : Add some way to optimize the game
	We cannot have tons of cards constantly wanting to update() or it will slow the game down
	Create a list of active cards and if a card is in that list, allow it to update

Each card type (Player, Settings, Enemy, Object) will need to be a child class of the base card class
