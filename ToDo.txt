Info ###########################################################################################################################
Each card type (Player, Settings, Entity, Object) will need to be a child class of the base card class
See examples to match card color and symbols
Tasks ##########################################################################################################################
- Sound Effects (Kunal)
	- When card attacks
	- When card dies
	- When clicking on an option in the menu, play a sound

- We all need to do testing because quite of bit of the things already there do not work correctly

- Attack system (Andrew)
	- Player health and damage goes down when he attacks
	- Replenish health or damage by consuming certain cards

- Player can consume certain cards (Andrew/Michael)
	- Doesn't work completely yet
	- the consumable is dragged ONTO the player, not the other way around
	- Milk replenish health(Michael)
		- Comes from the shack card

- Scoreboard (Kenny)
	- Increment score whenever the player kills something
	- Display score on the top of the screen
	- store high score and display it as well
	- this can be saved in a simple text file

- Save file system (Kenny)
	- only one save file
	- reset save file when new game is started
	- use a text file and store data in there
		- store attributes of each card, such as position, any counters, health/damage, etc

- Game Over Screen (Kunal)
	- reset save and produce game over screen when player health = 0
	- Only allows the user to press new game or exit
		- on exit, also make sure the save file is reset

- NPC class 
	- probably will need a special class for these cards

- When card is defeated, there should be a chance that it can drop stuff
	- Goblin card has a chance to drop a fork, knife, or spoon
		- 20% it will drop ONLY 1 card, it will be one of the above
	- The Gobo card has a 50% to drop another card that unlocks an extra setting that can spawn enemies
		- On getting this card the "shoes" NPC will spawn as well

- More card art and cards to use in the game
	- spoon, fork, and knife object cards
		- these cards can give the pkayer 1 attack or can be traded with the Moff card for something better
	- some sort of boss card
		- maybe spawn this card after 5 minutes?
	- At least 1 more setting card that spawns a different type of enemy card
	- object cards that the player can consume for health and damage points
		- Moff can spawn a Moff egg, gives the player 2 health and 1 damage
	- some sort of 'key' card that 'gobo' drops

- Menu button that opens a menu so the player can do 3 things: save, start a new game, or exit without saving

*Since basic functionality is almost done, we need to set up the spawns and progression for all of the other cards we have but not yet put into the game
	- There should be NPCs, more items, progression towards an end goal
	- Moff card should spawn occasionally, and then allow the player to give it weapon cards to trade for stuff (stuff to be determined)
		- This card eventually disappears somehow
		- 5% chance to spawn every second, stays in play for 1 minute
	- Shoes card is another NPC that can be given shoes in return for some other items (also to be determined)
		- Need to determine how to spawn this card
